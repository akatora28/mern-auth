# MERN Auth
A Simple Auth system for MERN stack apps, using JWT and Passport for authentication. Not really production ready, but just some code for small side-projects I'm working on that I don't want to use external auth services with.

Install & run with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Dependecies
* [bcryptjs]() - JS version of bcrypt for password hashing, using the pure JS version since the native bindings for bcrypt cause some installation errors on different machines
* [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) - Allow cross-origin api requests
* [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - Handle HTTP requests
* [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) - ORM for MongoDB

## Dev Dependencies
* [nodemon]()
* [dotenv]()
* [run-script-os]() - Cross-platform scripts
